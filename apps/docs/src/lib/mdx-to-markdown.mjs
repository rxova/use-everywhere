// Turn a docs page's markdown source into the plain markdown served at its `.md`
// twin (see src/pages/[...slug].md.ts).
//
// ## Why normalize the source rather than render and convert back
//
// Rendering to HTML and converting back would need a new dependency, and it would
// reformat every code fence on the way through — and the fences are the single
// thing an agent reading these pages actually wants verbatim. The body already is
// markdown for almost all of its bytes. What is left is a closed set of
// constructs, listed in the rules below; `scripts/check-md-routes.mjs` fails the
// build if a page grows one this file does not handle, so the set cannot quietly
// drift.
//
// ## The rule that matters
//
// Almost every `import` line in this content sits INSIDE a code fence — they are
// the illustrative snippets the docs are made of. There are currently no real MDX
// imports at all. So no rule may be applied blindly across the document:
// everything runs through `mapUnfenced`, and a fence's contents are never touched.
// Getting this wrong silently guts the examples, which is exactly the failure an
// agent would not notice and would then repeat.
//
// ## What this repo needs that react-inputs did not
//
// `resolveRelativeLinks`. These docs were migrated from Docusaurus and still write
// 235 links as `../core/transports.md` — doc-relative paths that Docusaurus mapped
// to routes and Astro emits verbatim. Left alone they would be copied into every
// twin and into llms-full.txt, where nothing can resolve them at all.
